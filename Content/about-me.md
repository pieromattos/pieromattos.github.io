# About me

My name is Piero Mattos, and I’m an iOS software developer based in Jundiaí, SP, Brazil.

I’m passionate about creating great user experiences through well crafted software. You can find more details about what type of work I have done in the past over on my LinkedIn profile on my Contact page.

During my free time I like to go out with friends, drink beer or coffee, and play videogames.

_“Some people express their deep appreciation in different ways. But one of the ways that I believe people express their appreciation to the rest of humanity is to make something wonderful and put it out there. But somehow, in the act of making something with a great deal of care and love, something is transmitted there. And it’s a way of expressing to the rest of our species our deep appreciation. So, we need to be true to who we are and remember what’s really important to us.”_
