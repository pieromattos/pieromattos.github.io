# "C is a very nice high-level language"

Yesterday I stumbled upon this 1982 video from the AT&T Archives about the then new UNIX operating system.
Five minutes in, [Brian Kernighan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Kernighan) provides an overview of how the UNIX operating system worked and how one could write a simple program for it using a novel feature the system had: the ability to pipe an output from one program as the input to another.
Amazing video. It gives us a really good sense of what computing and programming was like back then and is full of interesting tidbits and quotes like the one in the title of this post.
