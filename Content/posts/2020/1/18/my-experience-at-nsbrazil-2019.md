# My experience at NSBrazil 2019

Recently, I had the chance to attend [NSBrazil 2019](https://nsbrazil.com/en/), the biggest iOS developer conference in Brazil. The conference took place on the first weekend of November 2019 in São Paulo, and was full of interesting talks about iOS development and Swift.

I know it’s been a while already, but since the conference talk videos were just recently published on the [CocoaHeads Brasil YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/cocoaheadsbr), I though I’d list my favorite talks and maybe you can learn something new while watching them, just as I did. I hope you enjoy it!

_Quick disclaimer: except for one of them, all of the talks are in Brazilian Portuguese._

## Daniel Steinberg - A feel for Combine

Daniel is an amazing public speaker and a long-time conference speaker. A few months back I watched his talk about [The Swift Behind SwiftUI at Hacking With Swift Live 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eK8voQeokk) and it’s one of the most educational and entertaining talks I’ve seen so far.

At NSBrazil, Daniel talked about Combine, Apple’s new framework, which works in conjunction with SwiftUI to provide the new declarative syntax to create user interfaces for all of Apple’s platforms. Definitely worth a watch:

## Txai Wieser - Quem botou Swift na minha UI?

Txai gave us a little bit of insight into how SwiftUI works behind the scenes, explaining how views are laid out and how the relationships they have with their parent or child views affects their layout.

Amazing talk, as it gives you a more instinctive feel for how SwiftUI works and can greatly facilitate the transition from working with UIKit to SwiftUI, which we’ll all inevitably have to go through sooner or later.

## Bruno Rocha - Creating iOS apps with Buck without working in the Valley

Bruno’s talk was about how he and the iOS teams at iFood changed the way they work with their Xcode projects by using Buck, a build tool created by Facebook that can facilitate working with big codebases by providing better modularity, dependency management and incremental builds. Great talk!

## Igor Ferreira - Localização e Internacionalização: adaptando o seu app para onde a zoeira tem limite

Igor’s talk was certainly the most enthusiastic one of the whole conference. By sharing a little of his experience working with Localization and Internationalization of apps with us, he was able to bring to light a lot of common misconceptions and mistakes developers encounter when doing this type of work. Very useful content.
